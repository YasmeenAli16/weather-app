### Introduction:

This project is built to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.This project makes use of web APIs to load the data dynamically and update the UI. It makes fetch requests from OpenWeatherMap to retrieve current weather based on a given zip code value. It also saves the temperature along with other information to a local server which is set up with Node.js and Express. The starter code has all the elements in HTML and CSS, plus a little help getting started with the JavaScript. All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
